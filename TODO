Support compressed sections
   Newer debug objects have SHF_COMPRESSED, and need to be uncompressed.
   General idea for what to do:
        1: create sub IO-readers for sections from the object's IO reader,
        and use those rather than the objects.
        2: support a compressed reader that gets pushed on top of that
        for sections with the SHF_COMPRESSED flag

Support GNU_ref_alt
   dwz creates these

read memory contents for arg printing
   needs to support printing basic structures, scalars, pointers, etc.

Support rela for object files
   Can't do much with object files, but at least having the dump functions
   work would be nice.
